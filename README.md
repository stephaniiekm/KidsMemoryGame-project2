# **Memory Game – For Kids** - Website

**Memory Game** - is a card game, built as simple as possible for kids, the user should find it easy to understand rules and how to play.
The cards are chosen with purpose to get the user to really exercise the memory and see the difference between feelings (happy, sad, angry, and loving). 
The emojis is verry similar and it´s one of the challenges, not just to remind where the card is, also see the difference between them. 
Because it´s made for smaller kids it´s not so many cards.


The game is build user friendly and is responsive to different screens, with basic HTML, some CSS and JavaScript .

# Testing

## Functionality testing

I used Microsoft Edge developer tools and Chrome developer tools throughout 
the project for testing and solving problems with responsiveness and style issues.

## Compatibility testing

Site was tested across multiple virtual browsers, smaller screen (ipad), and mobile devices. 
I checked all supported devices in both Chrome developer tools and Microsoft Edge developer tools.
Most of the testing has been doing on a Laptop- Hp with Windows 10 
– With screen connecting to tv and larger screen, to look at the responsiveness.

### Features Left to Implement

- The game is created as basic as possible.

But it has the opportunity to develop with more styling, get more cards in the game, and fix the user should not be able to cheat by double clicking on the same card and also make the game more user clear through better focus effect.

## Testing 

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your project’s features and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

### Unfixed Bugs

You will need to mention unfixed bugs and why they were not fixed. This section should include shortcomings of the frameworks or technologies used. Although time can be a big variable to consider, paucity of time and difficulty understanding implementation is not a valid reason to leave bugs unfixed. 

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub) 

- The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows: 
  - In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab 
  - From the source section drop-down menu, select the Master Branch
  - Once the master branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.
