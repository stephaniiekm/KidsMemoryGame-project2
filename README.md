# **Memory Game – For Kids** - Website

**Memory Game** - is a card game, built as simple as possible for kids, the user should find it easy to understand rules and how to play.
The cards are chosen with purpose to get the user to really exercise the memory and see the difference between feelings (happy, sad, angry, and loving). 
The emojis is verry similar and it´s one of the challenges, not just to remind where the card is, also see the difference between them. 
Because it´s made for smaller kids it´s not so many cards.


The game is build user friendly and is responsive to different screens, with basic HTML, some CSS and JavaScript .

# Testing

## Functionality testing

I used Microsoft Edge developer tools and Chrome developer tools throughout 
the project for testing and solving problems with responsiveness and style issues.

## Compatibility testing

Site was tested across multiple virtual browsers, smaller screen (ipad), and mobile devices. 
I checked all supported devices in both Chrome developer tools and Microsoft Edge developer tools.
Most of the testing has been doing on a Laptop- Hp with Windows 10 
– With screen connecting to tv and larger screen, to look at the responsiveness.

### Features Left to Implement

- The game is created as basic as possible.

But it has the opportunity to develop with more styling, 
- get more cards in the game, 
- and fix the user should not be able to cheat by double clicking on the same card 
- and also make the game more user clear through better focus effect.

## Testing 

### Validator Testing

## Performance testing

I run [Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/) tool to check performance of the website.
I had to do couple of changes to improve performance

Final results:
 - Desktop:

- Mobile
